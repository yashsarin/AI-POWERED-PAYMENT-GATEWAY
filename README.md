<h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT: AI-Powered Payment Gateway with Fraud Detection and Insights</h2>
<h4>Objective:</h4>
Develop a sophisticated payment gateway interface that simulates processing payments, detects potential fraudulent transactions using AI, and provides insights on transaction patterns.

<h4>Details:</h4>
- Payment Form: Create a form for users to enter payment details (card number, expiry date, CVV).
- Transaction Simulation: Simulate processing the payment and returning a success or failure message.
- Fraud Detection: Implement a basic AI model to flag potential fraudulent transactions based on predefined criteria (e.g., transaction amount, location).
- Transaction Insights: Use AI to analyze transaction patterns and provide insights (e.g., common transaction times, high-risk areas).
